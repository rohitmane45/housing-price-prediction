# Housing Price Prediction Model 🏠

## Overview
This is my **first machine learning model** - a housing price prediction system built with Python and scikit-learn. The model predicts median house values based on various features using the California Housing dataset.

## Project Description

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting housing prices—a classic regression problem that demonstrates fundamental ML concepts. The system uses the California Housing dataset, which contains 20,640 records with features like location (latitude/longitude), housing age, room counts, population density, and median income to predict median house values.

**The Machine Learning Approach:**
The project employs a Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to provide robust and accurate predictions. The model was selected after comparing it with Linear Regression and Decision Tree models using 10-fold cross-validation, demonstrating superior performance in handling complex non-linear relationships in real estate data.

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
A sophisticated preprocessing pipeline handles mixed data types intelligently. Numerical features (rooms, age, population) undergo median imputation to handle missing values, followed by standard scaling to normalize their ranges. Categorical features (ocean proximity) are transformed using one-hot encoding. This stratified approach ensures each feature type is processed optimally while maintaining data integrity throughout the pipeline.

**Key Workflow:**
The system operates in two phases: training and inference. During training, data is split into 80/20 train-test sets using stratified sampling based on income categories to ensure balanced representation. The trained model and preprocessing pipeline are serialized using joblib for efficient deployment. During inference, the same pipeline transforms new data before making predictions, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

**Significance:**
As my first ML project, this demonstrates understanding of the complete machine learning lifecycle—from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. It showcases practical implementation of scikit-learn's powerful abstractions and best practices for building production-ready ML systems.
